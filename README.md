># README Generator!

For this Project I have put together a README Generator to take care of the hassles of README Creation for you. The composed README looks professional and has a table of contents and license info prepopulated!

---

>## Installation

This program uses a few basic node packages which are included in the package.json dependencies. If you clone the repo and run an 'npm i' command you will then have all the packages you need.

---

>## Usage

To use the program just run 'node index' in the terminal and the program will prompt you for the rest of the info it needs. The generated file will be called newREADME.md

---

>## Features

The readme will have all of the sections you need for a proffesional looking README file including installation instructions, contributions, license info, tests and a questions section which invites users to reach out with questions and comments.
